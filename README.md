# About
I have created a project using Python and Django that implements a registration and login authentication system. The project demonstrates my backend development skills, including my ability to work with databases and user authentication.

* The registration process involves collecting user information such as email, username, and password, and storing it securely in a SQLite database using Django's built-in user model. 
* The login process checks the user's credentials against the stored information and grants access to the site's features.
* The project includes features such as password reset, email verification, and secure password storage using *Argon2* hashing algorithms.
* the project utilizes Django's built-in forms and validation to ensure that the user inputs are valid and meet the specified criteria. It also implements session management to maintain the user's login status across multiple pages of the site.
